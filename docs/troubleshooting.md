# Troubleshooting

## No index found

Either the repository hasn't been indexed yet, or you're running the command outside any indexed directory.

```bash
vera index .
```

Run it from the repository root (the directory where `.vera/` should live). Search, grep, structural, references, overview, stats, and update commands resolve the nearest `.vera/` up the directory tree, so they also work from subdirectories.

## Results are stale

Code changed after the last index. Update it:

```bash
vera update .
```

The update runs from any subdirectory and refreshes the repository root's index. An identical stale warning is printed at most once every 10 minutes per index; set `VERA_STALE_WARNING_ALWAYS=1` to see it on every run.

## Results are irrelevant

Try narrowing your search:

- `--lang rust`: filter by language
- `--path "src/**/*.ts"`: filter by file path; repeat it to match any of several patterns
- `--type function`: filter by symbol type
- `--limit 5`: return fewer results
- Rewrite the query to be more specific about the behavior you're looking for

See the [query guide](query-guide.md) for more tips on writing effective queries.

## Exact-match searches

Use `vera grep` for exact string or regex matching across indexed files, and `rg` when you need counting, filename search, or files outside the index. Examples and syntax notes: [query guide](query-guide.md#when-to-use-vera-grep-vs-rg).

## A file is missing

`vera search` and `vera grep` only read indexed files. If the index is behind the working tree, Vera warns on stderr and shows how many files were added, modified, or deleted since the last refresh.

Refresh the index with:

```bash
vera update .
```

If you are editing continuously, keep the index current with:

```bash
vera watch .
```

## `.vera/` is committed to git

Add the project index to `.gitignore`:

```bash
printf '.vera/\n.vera.resume/\n' >> .gitignore
git rm -r --cached .vera
```

The index is machine-local and can be large.

## Does code leave the machine?

Local embedding and reranking modes send nothing off-machine. API mode sends chunk text and queries to the configured endpoint. The update check contacts GitHub once a day and can be disabled with `VERA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`. See [Privacy](../README.md#privacy).

## MCP server does not appear

Verify that `vera` is on the MCP client's `PATH`. If the client uses a restricted environment, set `command` to the absolute path of the Vera binary. Run `vera mcp` directly and inspect the client's MCP logs. See [MCP](mcp.md).

## Indexing is slow on a large monorepo

Use `.veraignore` for generated trees and vendor directories, and index the relevant project directory rather than the monorepo root. `vera update . --max-files 250` bounds one update run; use the value appropriate for the repository.

## Windows PATH after installation

The installer writes a shim to the user binary directory. Open a new shell after installation and confirm:

```powershell
Get-Command vera
vera --version
```

If the command is not found, add the installer-reported user bin directory to the user `PATH`, then open a new shell.

## API errors

Re-run setup and enter the endpoint URL, model ID, and API key when prompted:

```bash
vera setup --api
```

For non-interactive setup, check that all three environment variables are set before running `vera setup --api --yes`:

- `EMBEDDING_MODEL_BASE_URL`
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID`
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL_API_KEY`

If the active embedding model name differs from the one stored in the index, re-index the repo. For verified equivalent model names, configure `embedding.model_aliases` with `vera config set`, or set `VERA_EMBEDDING_MODEL_ALIASES` as semicolon-separated groups of comma-separated aliases, such as `canonical,alias`.

If you're using a reranker in non-interactive setup, its three variables (`RERANKER_MODEL_BASE_URL`, `RERANKER_MODEL_ID`, `RERANKER_MODEL_API_KEY`) must either all be set or all be absent. Partial configuration will fail.

On a 429 the reranker retries briefly and then returns unreranked results, because a minute-long wait is wrong for interactive search. For batch workloads against free-tier endpoints with per-minute quotas, set `VERA_RERANK_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT_SECS` (for example `65`) to make retries wait out the provider's reset window instead of degrading.

If the provider returns a batch-size error such as `at most 100 requests can be in one batch`, lower the embedding batch size:

```bash
vera config set embedding.batch_size 100
```

Vera clamps known provider limits automatically. Gemini embedding endpoints are capped at 100 inputs per request.

Embedding requests retry connection errors, 408, 429, and 5xx responses with jittered backoff, honoring `Retry-After` up to 60 seconds. A batch that times out or keeps failing goes to the back of the queue and is resent up to twice. Other 4xx responses and authentication errors fail at once. When indexing fails, stdout stays empty and stderr ends with a line of request, retry, and timeout counts followed by the error. Run `vera index` again: an API build resumes from the embeddings it already received.

Error messages never include the endpoint URL or bearer tokens. They name the underlying cause instead, such as `tcp connect error: Connection refused`.

If the provider returns `429` or `quota exceeded`, that is a provider-side limit. `embedding.max_concurrent_requests` only reduces how many requests Vera sends in parallel; it does not raise your API quota. Lower concurrency if you are hitting short burst limits, or wait for quota reset / enable billing if the project is out of quota.

## Index is incomplete

```text
the index at ... is incomplete because an update stopped before it finished writing
```

A `vera update` was interrupted while writing. Search and `vera stats` refuse the index instead of reading partial data. Run `vera update` to repair it, or `vera index` to rebuild.

## Reranker unavailable

`Warning: reranker unavailable (...)` on stderr means search returned unreranked results. The text in parentheses gives the cause. If reranking is enabled but no reranker is configured, configure an endpoint or turn reranking off:

```bash
vera config set retrieval.reranking_enabled false
```

`vera search --json --rerank-status` reports `reranked`, `reranker`, and `rerank_fallback_reason` alongside the results.

## ONNX Runtime errors

Run the diagnostic command first:

```bash
vera doctor
vera doctor --probe
vera doctor --probe --json
vera upgrade
```

Common causes:

- Models haven't been downloaded yet. Run `vera setup` for the default `minishlab/potion-code-16M-v2` static embedding model, which runs locally on CPU on any supported machine; no GPU or ONNX Runtime needed, or run `vera setup --potion-code` or the matching `--onnx-jina-*` setup command
- If assets are missing, corrupt, or truncated in the ONNX model cache, run `vera repair --<backend>` (such as `vera repair --onnx-jina-cuda` or `vera repair --potion-code`). `vera doctor` and embedding load errors detect damaged model files and print the matching repair command hint
- Local ONNX Runtime auto-download failed. Check network, or set `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` to a manually installed library
- If your network only allows browser downloads, use [manual-install.md](manual-install.md)
- GPU backend not working. Make sure the required drivers are installed (CUDA 12+ for `--onnx-jina-cuda`, ROCm for `--onnx-jina-rocm`, DirectX 12 for `--onnx-jina-directml`). CoreML (`--onnx-jina-coreml`) requires macOS on Apple Silicon. OpenVINO (`--onnx-jina-openvino`) and ROCm (`--onnx-jina-rocm`) are installed automatically via pip; if the automatic install fails, install manually (`pip install onnxruntime-openvino` or `pip install onnxruntime-rocm`), then set `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` to the `libonnxruntime.so` inside the package. If GPU init still fails, use the default `--potion-code` backend or fix the provider-specific dependencies.
- If CoreML reranking is enabled, it runs on CPU on Apple Silicon. CoreML accelerates the embedding model but **not** the reranker: no prebuilt reranker ONNX export is CoreML-compatible (the quantized Jina model has ops the CoreML EP cannot execute, and the fp16 export uses a float16 input dtype the CoreML EP rejects). Vera ships the quantized reranker for CoreML, which is the fastest CPU path, and selects the CPU execution provider for the reranker session explicitly. Do not assume ONNX Runtime falls back on its own: with the CoreML EP registered it still assigns a fused subgraph to CoreML, which builds successfully and then fails at inference with "Unable to compute the prediction using a neural network model (error code: -1)". `vera doctor --probe` flags this with a `probe-reranker-coreml-cpu` warning. Reranking is opt-in through `retrieval.reranking_enabled`; disable it with `vera config set retrieval.reranking_enabled false`.
- On CUDA backends, Vera uses the detected toolkit/runtime libraries (`CUDA_PATH`, CUDA's `version.json` or `version.txt`, `nvcc --version`, and on Linux also `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `ldconfig`) to choose the CUDA 12 vs CUDA 13 ONNX Runtime build instead of the driver's maximum supported version. If you switch CUDA toolkits, rerun `vera repair --onnx-jina-cuda` to refresh the downloaded runtime.
- On Windows DirectML, the ONNX Runtime is downloaded from NuGet (not GitHub releases). If the download fails, check your network or set `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` to a manually obtained `onnxruntime.dll` from the [Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML).
- On Windows, setup probes D3D12 adapter support before selecting DirectML; if no D3D12 device capability is found it falls back to CPU (Potion Code).
- `vera doctor` flags missing, corrupt, or truncated model caches or runtime, shows the saved and active backend, prints the installed Vera version, suggests `vera repair --<backend>`, and checks for newer releases. `vera doctor --probe` adds a deeper read-only local backend probe and does not download or repair missing assets. Both exit 1 when a check fails, so `vera doctor && vera index .` stops on a broken setup; a broken or unparseable `config.json` is reported as a hard failure, while warnings such as a missing config file or an unindexed working directory leave the exit code at 0. `vera repair` is the write path if you need Vera to re-fetch local assets. `vera upgrade` shows the binary update plan and can apply it when the install method is known.
- If a non-CPU ONNX session fails after dependency checks pass, Vera retries runtime embedding and reranker setup on CPU and logs a warning. Fix the GPU provider issue or switch to `--potion-code` if CPU fallback is too slow.

If API mode hits an `exceed_context_size_error` during indexing, update to the latest Vera build. Current releases split and shrink pathological embedding inputs instead of aborting the whole batch on one oversized chunk.

If Vera fails fast with a message like `CUDA backend selected, but required libraries are missing`, the ONNX Runtime CUDA provider was downloaded but your system linker cannot find the CUDA or cuDNN shared libraries it depends on. Install the required userspace libraries, refresh the linker cache if needed, then rerun `vera doctor --probe`.

## GPU out of memory

Vera auto-detects VRAM and adjusts batch size, but very low-VRAM GPUs (4 GB or less) may still run out of memory. Use the `--low-vram` flag:

```bash
vera index . --low-vram
```

This forces batch size 1 and caps the ONNX Runtime memory arena to 1 GB. You can also manually tune batch size with `vera config set embedding.batch_size 1`.

Vera does not send every local GPU batch to ONNX at the configured `embedding.batch_size`. It tokenizes first, shrinks long-sequence micro-batches, and learns safer limits per sequence-length bucket from real runs. Those learned windows are stored in `adaptive-batch-scaler.json` inside Vera's data directory and reused on later runs for the same backend, device, and model. CoreML uses sequence-length batching without model-size cold-start dampening because Apple Silicon uses unified memory. If a pathological batch still trips an allocation error, Vera retries it at a smaller size instead of aborting the whole index.

If you still see repeated retries or very slow indexing, lower `embedding.batch_size` manually or use `--low-vram`.

## Uninstall shim

Uninstall recognizes the PATH shim by matching the exact file the installer wrote (template match), not by parsing shell syntax, and it checks that the shim targets the binary recorded in `install.json` or a path inside the Vera data directory. It also resolves non-default `CARGO_HOME` locations when classifying cargo-installed binaries, so a custom cargo home is handled the same as the default.

## Building from source

On macOS 14+, the Xcode SDK compiles C dependencies (tree-sitter grammars, ring) for the running OS version, but Cargo's default minimum for `aarch64-apple-darwin` is macOS 11.0. The 11.0 ABI lacks newer symbols, so linking fails.

Set the deployment target to your running macOS version before building:

```bash
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET="$(sw_vers -productVersion)"
cargo build --release
```

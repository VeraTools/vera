# Architecture Decisions

These are the main technical choices behind Vera's current architecture. Earlier decisions were made during the initial spike phase, and later retrieval work was folded into the same benchmark-driven process.

| Area | Choice | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Language | Rust | [001](001-implementation-language.md) |
| Storage | SQLite + sqlite-vec + Tantivy | [002](002-storage-backend.md) |
| Embedding | Potion Code local default; API and Jina ONNX opt in | [003](003-embedding-model.md) |
| Chunking | Symbol-aware via tree-sitter AST | [004](004-chunking-strategy.md) |
| Retrieval | BM25 + Vector + RRF + Query-aware ranking + optional reranking | [005](005-query-aware-retrieval.md) |
| Ranking signals | Toggleable ranking signals, implemented separately from measurement | [006](006-ranking-signals.md) |
| Ranking hypotheses | Candidate-pool, path-penalty, and chunk-size hypotheses (rejected, removed in v2) | [007](007-ranking-hypotheses.md) |
| Filter-scan default | Filtered vector scans enabled by default after profiling | [008](008-filter-during-scan-default.md) |
| Filter-scan profiling | Persistent-index query-latency profile and bounded resident state | [009](009-filter-scan-profiling.md) |
| Reranker batching | Client-side batch setting retained as the batching contract | [010](010-reranker-server-batching.md) |

ADR 003 records the original spike evaluation. Its default-model conclusion was superseded in v1.1.0; the table above reflects the current default.

Early spike code was removed from the tree before v1.0; it remains in git history under `spikes/`.
